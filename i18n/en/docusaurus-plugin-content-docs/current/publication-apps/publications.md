- You have uploaded the images and application icon in the Partner Panel, paying attention to the requested dimensions for each field;
- You have completed the application description (short and long) in the Partner Panel;
- Your application has gone through the homologation process and has been approved.

:::warning
Our team will only begin the approval process after receiving all artifact and publication documents.
It is important to follow all these processes to expedite the publication of your application in the App Store and make it available to merchants.
