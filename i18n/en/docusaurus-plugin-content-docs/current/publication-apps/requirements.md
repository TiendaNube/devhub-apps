# Mandatory requirements

## 1. App images

* Download the promotional images for the app from **“App Images”**, which will only be approved if they are the correct required size of **1600 x 800px**.

These images should showcase the app's screens and highlight its main features, sparking the retailer's interest in installing it. The same images are shared across all languages, so if your app is published in all countries, the text in the images must be in both Portuguese and Spanish.

## 2. Application icon

Download the app icon from **“Icon”**, which will only be approved if it is the correct required size of **600 x 600px**. This image will be your app’s logo.

## 4. App profile description

* In the **"Information"** section, fill in the application description fields. This is the most important part. The information in the **"short"** and **"long"** description fields will be your app's showcase in the App Store — what merchants will see and what will encourage them to install it.

Nuvemshop has created a guide to ensure your description includes as many keywords as possible, guaranteeing good performance in App Store searches when merchants look for a feature or need that your app solves. Use this exact structure:

## ⭐ Good practices for these forms

Follow the structure of the application description guide above exactly.

You also have the option of using Nuvemshop's Artificial Intelligence Agent, the **"App Description Generator in the Nuvemshop App Store"**, to help you create this complete description quickly and easily.

1. Access the ChatGPT agent **[“Tiendanube Appstore Description Generator”](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-684a0c4e5ee8819199c155f69f465e4e-tiendanube-appstore-description-generator)**. Clicking the link will start the interactive generation of the long description.
2. **Define the information sources:** insert the URL of your app's official website, links to articles or tutorials from the Help Center, and/or upload a document (PDF or DOCX) with an overview of the features, ensuring coverage of all sections of the guide (purpose, benefits, features, etc.).
3. **Specify the publication regions and specific details:** indicate the countries where the app will be available and detail any differences in features by region (for example, a tax module active only in Chile), so that the agent can adapt the content accordingly.
4. **Please wait for the generation of SEO-optimized HTML blocks for embedding:** the agent will deliver, directly in the chat, an HTML code block for each defined country, preceded by a comment. These blocks will be ready to be incorporated into the existing application page, respecting the heading hierarchy and avoiding element conflicts, adapted to the local language, such as Portuguese for Brazil or Spanish for Argentina.
5. **Publish in the Nuvemshop integration panel:** copy each returned HTML block and paste it into the description field corresponding to each country in the integration editor; then save and publish the changes.
