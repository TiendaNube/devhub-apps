title: Landing Page
---

Installing the application represents only the first step of the partner journey. For those entering a managed and assisted onboarding flow, displaying a **Landing Page** provides greater **clarity, alignment, and understanding of the next steps** for the merchant.

## :dart: Essential Functions of the Landing Page

### 1. Clarity and Direction of the Next Step
- After installation, the Landing Page should act as a **visual guide**, clearly directing the merchant on what to do next.
- This guidance is essential to prevent a drop in engagement immediately after the application is installed.

### 2. Preparation for Assisted Onboarding
- In flows that require management and follow-up, the Landing Page should serve as the central point where the partner can:
  - complete the **pre-registration**;
  - schedule the first contact (when applicable); or
  - receive information indicating that the responsible team will reach out.

### 3. Resource Centralization
- The Landing Page acts as a **temporary hub**, centralizing essential documentation such as **FAQs, tutorial videos, and partnership policies**.
- This approach optimizes the connection with the merchant by enabling them to obtain the required initial knowledge through a **self-service** experience.

## :sparkles: Benefits of the Flow

- **Increased activation rate:** Well-informed and properly guided partners are significantly more likely to complete onboarding and become active users of the application.
- **Early qualification:** The Landing Page can include forms that support partner qualification and segmentation, allowing account managers to personalize their approach even before the first interaction.
- **Professional and trustworthy experience:** A structured flow conveys professionalism and trust, reinforcing the value of both the partnership and the application from the very beginning.
