# App Approval Process - Nuvemshop

**What is an app approval?**

Approval is the process of **validating and certifying** an application within the Nuvemshop ecosystem. 
<br>This process ensures that the app meets the expected technical and functional criteria, ensuring an efficient and secure integration.</br>
Depending on the type of application developed, the approval process may follow different paths, such as:

* **Asynchronous Approval:** In this process, all artifacts must be submitted for review, and our team will perform validation tests. 
* **Synchronous Approval:** This scenario applies to apps that handle sensitive data, such as ERP, Payments, and Shipping, where validation must be performed jointly. Our team will schedule a meeting with the requester to go through the app and validate it using a checklist.</br></br></br>

**Asynchronous approval**

* For asynchronous approvals, once all artifacts are submitted, the team will analyze the materials and conduct the necessary tests. 
* If all criteria are met, the app will proceed to the publishing phase, and you will receive further information for tracking.
* If issues are identified during testing based on the submitted artifacts, we will provide a report listing each item that needs adjustment.
* Once corrections are made, the partner must respond in the same location with supporting evidence so we can revalidate the scenarios.
* This cycle will repeat until all required adjustments are completed, ensuring the app's quality before publication.

**Synchronous approval**

* Through your approval request, our team will be available for support and to answer any questions at any time, especially before the meeting.
* During the synchronous session, we will review all items in the checklist*, ensuring a more robust and complete validation process.
* If the checklist is validated with no further changes needed at the end of the meeting, the app will proceed to the App Store publishing stage.
* If adjustments are necessary, they will be documented in the checklist and can be accessed by the partner via the Action Plan tab.
* After the changes have been implemented, a new session will be scheduled to validate the remaining items from the previous review.
* This process will repeat until all items are completed, allowing the app to move forward to the App Store.
