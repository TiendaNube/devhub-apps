# Practical Guide to Publishing your App in the App Store
Guide to be inserted in this official documentation after the approval stage to instruct partners in the application publication stage.

## Overview

In this section, we'll provide a step-by-step guide to publishing your app on the Nuvemshop App Store. After app approval, you'll need to fill out required fields on the Nuvemshop Partner Portal, in the "Publication Data" section. Learn how to publish your app through the Partner Portal:

### Publishing an application on Nuvemshop

Through the “Publication Data” section, you can publish your application to be made available on [Nuvemshop App Store](https://www.tiendanube.com/tienda-aplicaciones-nube).

* Within the dashboard, click on "Publishing Data" and "Edit Data" to continue.

* Make sure all fields “**URLs and contact**” and “**Application handle**” are duly completed

## Mandatory requirements

### 1.App banners

* Upload the app's promotional images at “**App screenshots**”, which will only be approved if they are in the correct requested dimension of 1600 x 800px. These images must be images that show the application screens and publicize its main features, arousing the store owner's interest in installing it.Currently, these banners are shared across all languages, so if your app will be published in all countries, the text must be in both Portuguese and Spanish.

The information present in the **“short” and “long” description fields**, will be your app's showcase in the App Store, what merchants  will see and encourage them to install it. Nuvemshop created a guide to ensure your description contains as many keywords as possible, ensuring a good return in the App Store search field when merchants search for a feature or need your app solves.

### Good practices

Follow the structure of the App Description Guide above exactly. You also have the option to use the Nuvemshop AI Agent “Application Description Generator in Nuvemshop App Store”to help you create this complete description quickly and easily.

* Access the ChatGPT agent “[Tiendanube Appstore Description Generator](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-684a0c4e5ee8819199c155f69f465e4e-tiendanube-appstore-description-generator)” by clicking the link to start the interactive generation of the long description.
* **Define the sources of information:** insert the URL of your app's official website, links to articles or tutorials from the Help Center, and/or upload a document (PDF or DOCX) with an overview of its features, ensuring that all blocks of the guide are covered (objective, benefits, features, etc.).
* **Specify publishing regions and particulars:** Enter the countries where the app will be available and detail any feature differences by region (for example, a tax module only active in Chile), so the agent can adapt the content accordingly.
* **Wait for SEO-optimized and embed HTML blocks to be generated:** The agent will deliver, directly in the chat, a block of HTML code for each defined country, preceded by the comment <!-- Description [country] -->. These blocks will be ready to be incorporated into the existing application page, respecting the title hierarchy and avoiding element conflicts, adapted to the local language, such as Portuguese for Brazil or voseo for Argentina.
* **Publish to Nuvemshop integration panel:** Copy each returned HTML block and paste it into the description field for each country in the integration editor, then save and publish your changes.

### App icon

Upload the app icon from **“Icon”**, which will only be approved if it is the correct requested dimension of 600 x 600px. This image must be your app's main logo.
