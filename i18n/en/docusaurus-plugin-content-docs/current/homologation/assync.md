## Asynchronous Approval

Apps that do not involve flows with sensitive data require an **asynchronous approval**, in which the technical team will analyze the submitted artifacts and perform tests on the application. <br/>
The outcome of this analysis, as well as any necessary communication, will take place directly **within the open request**. <br/>
Therefore, it is extremely important to follow the steps outlined below to ensure an **agile**, **coherent**, and **Nuvemshop-compliant** approval process.

**1. Asynchronous Approval Flow**

To ensure an efficient and organized process, follow the steps below for the asynchronous approval of your app on the platform:

1.1. **Approval Request**  
* Go to your app's page in the **Partner Panel**.  
* Click **"Request Approval"**.  
* The platform will send a message with the next steps.

1.2. **Artifact Submission**  
* After receiving feedback from our team, you must **submit the artifacts** according to the mandatory requirements [hyperlink to the mandatory requirements section].  
* Make sure to include all necessary elements for a complete evaluation.

1.3. **Artifact Validation**  
* The **approval team** will review each submitted item.  
* The team will reproduce the **installation and configuration** of the app, ensuring that the merchant experience is smooth and intuitive.  
* The process will follow **API usability best practices**, ensuring adherence to expected standards.

1.4. **Approval Feedback**  
* The partner must **wait for the estimated timeframe** (provided during the first contact from our team) to receive the feedback through the same communication channel.  
* If all tests are successfully validated, the app will proceed to the **publishing phase**.  
* If any **pending issues, access limitations, or bugs** are identified, the approval team will send a **detailed report** with the required adjustments.  
* The partner must apply the corrections and provide evidence that the issues have been resolved.  
* After this phase, the app will move forward for **publication on the App Store**.
