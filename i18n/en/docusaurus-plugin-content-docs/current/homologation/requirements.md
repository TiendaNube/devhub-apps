## Mandatory Requirements for App Approval

To ensure an effective approval process, it is mandatory for partners to submit the following items for platform analysis. These elements are essential to validate the app's functionality and compliance with the established guidelines.

**1. Submission of Sequence Diagram**

The sequence diagram must illustrate how the permissions (scopes) selected during app creation are being used.  
This document is essential for understanding the authentication flows and the app's interaction with the platform.  
To learn more about how to create a sequence diagram, access the support document at this link: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MFpRkSTDF2hPrvITL5H0Vw9NyT9c_Pm1cq7Gsf73LmM/edit" target="_blank">Sequence Diagram Guide</a>.

**2. Submission of App Demo Video**

The demo video must include the following scenarios:

* App installation from Nuvemshop and not via the app panel.
    * To simulate this scenario, use the URL: `https://www.tiendanube.com/apps/(app_id)/authorize`.
    * Replace `(app_id)` with your app’s ID, available in the partner panel.
* Registration of a user who doesn’t yet have an account.
* Demonstration of login for an already registered user.
* Scenarios involving app reinstallation and behavior after removal and reinstallation.
* Simulation of all scenarios described in the sequence diagram, ensuring that all permissions and flows are clearly defined.
* App usage flow, showing the main features provided.
* Relevant points for evaluation, such as specific interactions essential for approval.
* If any technical setup is required to use the app, it’s recommended to clearly specify and guide the merchant on how to perform it.

**3. Attention to Subscription Steps and Restrictions**

If your app includes a subscription plan, or if a waiting period is needed for registration approval or any other step that could prevent immediate validation, <br/>
**provide a demo account that has already bypassed these steps**, allowing the approval team to access and validate without interruptions to the process.

:::warning Important
Submitting these requirements correctly will ensure a faster, more efficient approval process, allowing your app to move forward to the publishing phase without setbacks.
