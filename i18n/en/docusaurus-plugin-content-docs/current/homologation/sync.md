## Synchronous Approval

If the app **is of the ERP, Payments, or Shipping types** or handles **sensitive data**, a **synchronous approval** process will be required. <br/>
In this case, the technical team will **review the submitted artifacts** along with a **joint validation stage**, involving direct interaction between the partner and the approval team, going through all items in the checklist.

**1. Approval Request**

- Access the app page in your **Partner Panel**.
- Click on **"Request Approval"**.
- The platform will send a message outlining the next steps.

**2. Artifact Submission**

- After receiving the communication, the partner must **submit the artifacts for review**, according to the mandatory requirements described on the platform.
- All submitted items will be reviewed by the approval team.

**3. Initial Validation**

- The **approval team** will perform the initial review of the submitted artifacts.
- The **installation and configuration** of the app will be reproduced to ensure the merchant experience is intuitive and aligned with API best practices.

**4. Synchronous Step – Live Validation**

- Instead of proceeding directly to publishing, a **Google Meet call** will be scheduled with the approval team.
- During the session, we will go **through each item in the checklist** used during app development.
- We'll ensure that all points were properly implemented and are functioning as expected.

**5. Adjustment Logging (If Needed)**

- If any **pending issues are found in the checklist**, they will be documented under the **"Action Plan"** tab of the checklist.
- The partner will be able to monitor which items need to be addressed.

**6. Revalidation and Publishing**

- After making the necessary corrections, the partner must schedule a **new validation date** with the approval team.
- This process will be repeated until all required adjustments are completed.
- Once all items are successfully validated, the app will proceed to **publication in the App Store**.

### 1. Approval Process Checklist

The checklist will be used as a **guide** for the **synchronous approval** process of apps in the following categories:

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1J9FTlACvdOXYeigZ3F1DpR9ZUkntEaTWZhD5aVxVWhI/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">ERP</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14K4y3GTYL-NDhHQOP1XTe-Clsh-UcFC6aevyVq59CoY/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Payments</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dgKY2Ze9ZB4bqIXDuGiJzdVCCNEZgtO7BodrunRGowI/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Shipping</a></li>
</ul>

These applications require a specific validation step to ensure that all expected scenarios and behaviors function correctly.
During the approval meeting, we’ll go through each item in the checklist to validate essential aspects such as:

- Compliance with platform rules;
- Functional and API integration testing;
- User experience and usability;
- Security and performance.
