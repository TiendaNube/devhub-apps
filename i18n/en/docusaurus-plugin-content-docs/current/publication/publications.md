- You completed the description (short and long) of your application in the Partner Panel;
- Your application went through the homologation process and was approved.

:::warning
Our team will only begin the approval process after receiving these artifact and publication documents.
It is important to follow all these processes to expedite the publication of your application in the App Store and make it available to our merchants.
