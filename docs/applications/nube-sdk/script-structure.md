import { Alert, Text, Box } from '@nimbus-ds/components';
import AppTypes from '@site/src/components/AppTypes';

## Script structure

The main entry point for the script is located in `src/main.ts`.

```typescript
import type { NubeSDK } from "@tiendanube/nube-sdk-types";

export function App(nube: NubeSDK) {
  // your code goes here
}
```

This exported function, `App(nube: NubeSDK)` is called by the NubeSDK during initialization, and it's the main entry point for your application's script.

The received `nube: NubeSDK` object contains all the helper functions required to interact with the sdk.

```typescript
export type NubeSDK = {
  // Start listening to an event
  on(event: NubeSDKListenableEvent, listener: NubeSDKListener): void;
  // Stop listening to an event
  off(event: NubeSDKListenableEvent, listener: NubeSDKListener): void;
  // Dispatch an event
  send(event: NubeSDKSendableEvent, modifier?: NubeSDKStateModifier): void;
  // Get current state
  getState(): Readonly<NubeSDKState>;
};
```

The programming model used by NubeSDK is mostly event based, that is, the SDK dispatches events to report changes in the store, and sometimes expects events as response.

### Listening to events

Listening to events is done through the received `nube` instance:

```typescript
import type { NubeSDK } from "@tiendanube/nube-sdk-types";

export function App(nube: NubeSDK) {
// Listen to cart update event, dispatched every time that the cart is updated
nube.on("cart:update", ({ cart }) => {
  // Log the total price of the cart to console
  console.log(cart.prices.total);
});
}
```

### Dispatching events

Dispatching events is done through the received `nube` instance:

```typescript
import type { NubeSDK } from "@tiendanube/nube-sdk-types";

export function App(nube: NubeSDK) {
  // Listen to cart update event, dispatched every time that the cart is updated
  nube.on("cart:update", ({ cart }) => {
    // Reject the cart if it has fewer than 5 items
    if (cart.items.length < 5) {
      // Dispatch a failed `cart:validate` event with the reason why it failed to validate
      nube.send("cart:validate", () => ({
        cart: {
          validation: {
            status: "fail",
            reason: "Cart must have at least 5 items!",
          },
        },
      }));
    } else {
      // Dispatch a successful `cart:validate` event
      nube.send("cart:validate", () => ({
        cart: {
          validation: {
            status: "success",
          },
        },
      }));
    }
  });
}
```

### Script configuration

There is a special event that can be dispatched by the script to configure some special parameters related to the behavior of the script:

```typescript
import type { NubeSDK } from "@tiendanube/nube-sdk-types";

export function App(nube: NubeSDK) {
// Tell NubeSDK that this script wants to validate the content of the cart
nube.send("config:set", () => ({
  config: {
    has_cart_validation: true
  },
}));
}
```

In this example, the script is telling `NubeSDK` that it wants to validate the content of the cart.
